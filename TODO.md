1. Build random number generator that assigns random number to a string in a form.
    - This should be very basic to start with. Don't worry about number of players or adding and subtracting forms. Start with a basic amount and continue from there.
    - I may need to take a step back from the inputs. Perhaps tomorrow I should build an input component that generates the player name inputs depending on the number entered in first input. Trying to get the individual state to work on each input is proving difficult, need to come back later.
